            I have a strong passion for crafting software solutions that blend
            innovation with functionality. My drive stems from the satisfaction
            of creating things that not only work seamlessly but also bring
            value to users and businesses alike.

            I started my programming journey at Vanier College in 2022, worked
            with many programming languages like Java and C# , as well as HTML,
            CSS, and JavaScript, worked with databases and SQL, Linux, and Git,
            and much more tools. Still learning to this day as this field keeps
            expanding, my aim is to master this craft as much as I love doing
            it.
